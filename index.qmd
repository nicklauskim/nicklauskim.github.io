Welcome to my professional and academic portfolio.

I'm a statistician and data scientist passionate about using my mathematical background and programming skills to build tools like data visualization platforms and production-level statistical learning models. I have experience in statistical and machine learning research in academia and a diverse set of data analysis/science skills. In particular I specialize in Python, R, SQL, and Dash â€” and I love turning complex data into intuitive interfaces that enable visual storytelling.

Here is some of my highlighted work:

* [Synthetic Data Research](projects/posts/ms-thesis/index.qmd)
    + Data-centric Machine Learning
    + Generative Modeling
    + Data Privacy (Differential Privacy)
* [NBA Data Dashboard](projects/index.qmd)
    + Dynamic Data Visualization with Dash and Plotly
    + Rich Database Served with FastAPI
    + Video Generation Engine
<!--* [Founding Fathers Correspondence Network](projects/index.qmd)
    + Flask Web Programming
    + Knowledge Graphs
    + Large Language Model Topic Analysis-->
