Welcome to my professional and academic portfolio.

I recently completed my M.S. in Statistics at UCLA and am currently searching for research-oriented statistician or data scientist/analyst opportunities. I'm passionate about using my mathematical background and programming skills to build tools like data dashboards and production-level statistical learning models to help uncover meaningful insights about data. I have experience in statistical and machine learning research in academia and a diverse set of data science skills; in particular I specialize in Python, R, Dash, and SQL (PostgreSQL).
<!--â€” and I love turning complex data into intuitive interfaces that enable visual storytelling.-->


> You can find the source code for my data science projects and other work I've done at my [GitHub](https://github.com/nicklauskim){.underline}.
